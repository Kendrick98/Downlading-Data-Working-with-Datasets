# Just fooled around, downloading datasets and creating working visualizations of that data, i worked on different small projects using the common data
# formats CSV and JSON. Used the csv module to process the weather data stored in the CSV format and analyze high and low temperatures orver time in
# different locations, then used Matplotlib to generate a chart based on the data i downloaded. Later i used the json module to acess earthquake data
# stored in GeoJSON foramt and used Plotly to draw a world map showing the locations and magnitudes of the earthquakes.
# The data i used is from 2021; its was easier to get a hold on because it was provided by the book i followed through these projects.
